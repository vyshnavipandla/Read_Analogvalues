Servomotor Controlled by Potentiometer:
This guide demonstrates how to interface a servomotor with either ESP32 or Arduino Uno using a potentiometer. 
The servo angle is dynamically adjusted based on the analog input obtained from the potentiometer.
In the ESP32, the analog pins for ADC1 are 32-39 (8 channels), 
for ADC2, they are 0, 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 25, 26, and 27 (10 channels)
